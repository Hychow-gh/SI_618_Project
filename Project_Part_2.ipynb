    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook constitutes Part 2 of our project, building directly on the merged and cleaned dataset we finalized in Part 1. In the first phase, we successfully combined two key CMS datasets: the **Hospital General Information** (providing hospital characteristics and quality ratings) and the **Promoting Interoperability** (providing facility-level EHR technology data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to conduct a formal statistical analysis to extract insights and find significant associations within our data. As per the course guidelines, our focus is on **statistical analysis (Part 2)**, not predictive modeling (which is reserved for Part 3). Therefore, our objective is to identify and quantify relationships, not to determine causation or predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will be guided by the three \"real-world\" questions we posed in Part 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Do hospitals with a certified EHR system report higher overall quality scores compared to those without a reported system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Is there a discernible difference in quality outcomes among hospitals using different major EHR vendors (e.g., Epic vs. Cerner vs. MEDITECH)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are specific types of hospitals, such as smaller or rural \"Critical Access Hospitals,\" lagging in EHR adoption, and does this correlate with their reported outcomes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these questions, this notebook will proceed through each required component of the analysis: **Descriptive Statistics**, **Inferential Statistics** (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-Squared), **Graphical Analysis**, **Comparative Analysis**, and **Multivariate Analysis**. Finally, we will **Synthesize** our findings to provide statistical answers to our research questions and **Reflect** on the discoveries and limitations of this analysis.\n"

    "Based on our `describe()` output, we have several key findings for our primary outcome variable, `rating_numeric`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Significant Missing Data:** The `count` is **2,872**. This is a critical finding. Out of our total ~5,381 hospitals, only 2,872 have a usable numeric rating. This indicates that our \"overall rating\" analysis will only apply to this subset, a key limitation we must discuss in our `Reflection`.\n",
    "* **Central Tendency:** The `mean` (average) rating is **3.08**, and the `50%` (median) is **3.0**. These values are very close, suggesting a relatively symmetric distribution (not heavily skewed) centered around an \"average\" 3-star rating.\n",
    "* **Spread:** The `std` (standard deviation) is 1.1, and the interquartile range (IQR) is from 2.0 (`25%`) to 4.0 (`75%`), which confirms a typical spread across the 1-5 star scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Analysis: Categorical Variables***\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main categorical variables provide the context for our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **EHR Adoption Status (`Has_EHR`):** The split is **63.4% 'Yes'** and **36.6% 'No'**. This is an excellent, well-balanced split. It provides a substantial \"No\" group for comparison, making our first research question (comparing \"Yes\" vs. \"No\") statistically robust.\n",
    "* **EHR Vendor Distribution (`EHR_Vendor`):** The most striking finding is that the **'Other' category accounts for 87.7%** of all hospitals. This \"Other\" group includes both the \"No\" hospitals (36.6%) and all unmapped smaller vendors (51.1%). This indicates the EHR market is highly fragmented, and our vendor-specific analysis will be a comparison between a few identified vendors (like `Epic Systems`) and this large, diverse \"Other\" group.\n",
    "* **Hospital Types:** The output snippet (e.g., `Psychiatric`, `Childrens`) shows the diversity of hospital types in our dataset. As we will see in section `1e`, these specialized hospitals have unique characteristics (like 0% EHR adoption in this specific program, and `NaN` ratings) that are critical to our third research question."

    "***Analysis: Research Question 1 (Has_EHR vs. Rating)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of section `1c` provides a direct answer to our first research question: \"Do hospitals with a certified EHR system report higher overall quality scores?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Finding:** The descriptive statistics show **no meaningful difference** in quality ratings between hospitals with and without a reported EHR system.\n",
    "* **The Numbers:**\n",
    "    * The `mean` (average) rating for the **'No'** group is **3.14**, which is surprisingly slightly *higher* than the `mean` for the **'Yes'** group (**3.07**).\n",
    "    * The `50%` (median) for both groups is identical at **3.0**.\n",
    "* **Conclusion:** This strongly supports our finding from Part 1's boxplot. At the descriptive level, our data does not support the hypothesis that simply having a certified EHR is associated with a higher hospital rating. This sets the stage for our `t-test` in the next section to confirm if this tiny difference is statistically significant (it likely isn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Analysis: Research Question 2 (EHR\\_Vendor vs. Rating)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of section `1d` explores our second question: \"Is there a difference in outcomes among hospitals using different EHR vendors?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Finding:** Yes, unlike the simple \"Yes/No\" comparison, the choice of EHR vendor appears to be associated with **clear differences** in average ratings.\n",
    "* **The Numbers:**\n",
    "    * `Epic Systems Corporation` hospitals have the highest average rating at **3.27**.\n",
    "    * `VigiLanz Corporation` hospitals have the lowest average rating at **2.75**.\n",
    "    * The large `Other` group (which includes the 'No' group) sits in the middle with a mean of **3.08**.\n",
    "* **Conclusion:** This is a much more nuanced and interesting finding. It suggests that while *adoption* itself isn't a clear predictor of quality, the *specific system* a hospital uses (or the type of hospital that chooses a specific system) **is** correlated with different quality outcomes. This strongly suggests our `ANOVA` test will be statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Analysis: Research Question 3 (Hospital Type, Adoption, & Outcomes)***\n",
    "\n",
    "Section `1e` provides two profound answers to our third, most complex question regarding \"Critical Access Hospitals\" and specialty hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finding 3a (Adoption): Our hypothesis was wrong.**\n",
    "    * We hypothesized that smaller, rural `Critical Access Hospitals` would \"lag behind\" in EHR adoption.\n",
    "    * The data shows the **opposite**: `Critical Access Hospitals` have an adoption rate of **76.7%**, which is actually *higher* than the `Acute Care Hospitals` (**75.6%**).\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** The data refutes our initial assumption. The real story is that certain specialty hospitals (like `Childrens`, `Psychiatric`, and `VA`) show 0% adoption *in this specific dataset*, likely because they do not participate in this particular CMS reporting program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finding 3b (Outcomes): The \"Overall Rating\" metric is not universal.**\n",
    "    * The output for `Childrens` and `Psychiatric` hospitals shows `NaN` for all rating statistics.\n",
    "    * **Conclusion:** This is a critical data discovery. It explains *why* our `rating_numeric` variable had so many missing values (as seen in `1a`). The \"Hospital overall rating\" metric **is not applicable** to these specialty hospitals. This is a crucial data limitation to discuss, and it correctly tells us that we cannot use this specific rating to assess their outcomes."
