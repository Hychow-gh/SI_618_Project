    "### 1. Introduction & Analytical Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous parts of this project, we merged CMS datasets to explore the relationship between Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption and hospital quality ratings. In Part 2, statistical tests revealed that while the mere presence of an EHR system wasn't statistically linked to higher ratings, the **choice of Vendor** and **Hospital Type** showed significant associations with quality outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Goal for Part 3:**\n",
    "The goal of this final phase is to move from description to **prediction**. We aim to build a **Classification Model** to predict a hospital's \"Overall Rating\" (on a scale of 1 to 5) based on its structural characteristics (Ownership, Type) and operational metrics (Mortality, Safety, Readmission counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Classification:**\n",
    "We chose Classification (rather than Clustering) because our dataset contains a clear, ground-truth label: the `Hospital overall rating`. By treating this rating as a class label (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), we can supervise the learning process and directly evaluate how well our features can distinguish between high-performing and low-performing hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1.  **Preprocessing:** Handling hidden missing values (e.g., \"Not Available\"), scaling numerical features, and One-Hot Encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "2.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying PCA to reduce feature space and noise.\n",
    "3.  **Modeling:** Implementing and comparing **Random Forest** (ensemble method) and **Logistic Regression** (linear method).\n",
    "4.  **Optimization:** Using GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters."
